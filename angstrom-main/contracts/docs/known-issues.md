# Known Issues
- `PoolConfigStore` does not check that `tickSpacing < MAX`
- pair fee (`feeInE6`) rounds in favor of the protocol i.e. fee could be more than the configured
percentage *if* the fee to be charged is a fractional amount. Then it's rounded up to the nearest
base unit.
- decoding can devolve into infinite loop resulting in OOG error if incorrectly encoded
- can only encode up to `N` of `X` => limited count of assets, pairs and orders is intentional 
- can only specify output for partial orders
- can add liquidity to disabled but already initialized pools
- can only configure 1 Uniswap AMM pool at a time
- no events: we avoid events to save gas and also to simplify the later fee summary event
co-processing logic
- use of custom `controller` auth logic instead of standard `Ownable`: standard `Ownable` typically
  tracks events as well as a redundant `renounceOwnership` function which we do not need for our use
  case.
- while the contract guarantees a common price (not including fees) for any pair `A:B` if you have
pairs `A:B`, `B:C` & `A:C` it **is not** guaranteed that you'll have the same price for `A:C` by
going across `A:B x B:C` & `A:C`

## Bundle Building Footguns
- **Can burn by donating to upper bound**

    Liquidity positions do not include the upper bound, donating to the upper bound will not credit
positions which do not otherwise encompass that tick and may even burn the tokens if you donate to
the highest uninitialized bound.
- **Can burn funds by donating to current tick**

    Donating/rewarding the current tick can burn funds if there's no active liquidity.
- **Donating to far out ticks can cause OOG**
    The gas cost of `_decodeAndReward` for multiple ticks is proportional to the distance from the
current tick. Therefore trying to donate to a for out tick may not be feasible within a single
block.
