## Architecture

**Methods**

- `execute`:  Entrypoint for pool update, ToB + user order processing functionality & exact make up
  described in [`bundle-building`](./bundle-building.md) & [`payload-types`](./payload-types.md)
- `deposit`: Allows users to deposit funds into Angstrom for later trading (allows for gas savings
vs. ERC20 with allowance usage)
- `withdraw`: Counterpart to `deposit` allows users to take back funds
- `invalidateNonce`: Lets users invalidate "standing orders" by marking the associated nonce as used
