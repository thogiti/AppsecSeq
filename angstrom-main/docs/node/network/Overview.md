## Swarm
The swarm deals with message dispatch allong with peer tracking and is just a middle struct that acts as a
seperator to the manager

in charge of making sure that we always know who is a validator. The state tracker also hold the peer manager, which
is just a behavior rating system for each peer so that we can monitor and possible disconnect from any missbehaving peer.
